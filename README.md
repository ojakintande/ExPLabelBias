# ExPLabelBias
Idealization stage - current results fall short of expectation. The trying continues!

- **Causal Bayesian Denoising with Demographic-Adaptive Noise Priors** (CBD-DANP) proposes a framework with a compelling integration of Bayesian modeling, causal inference, and fairness constraints to address label subjectivity in demographic-based depression prediction. 

- CBD-DANP stands out by treating noise as demographic-cluster-dependent (e.g., higher mislabeling in certain age/gender groups due to cultural biases in self-reporting), using SCMs to disentangle confounders (e.g., income influencing both depression risk and reporting accuracy), and embedding fairness penalties (e.g., via regularized posteriors) in a unified Bayesian setup. This is underexplored; searches for direct analogs (e.g., "Causal Bayesian Denoising with Demographic-Adaptive Noise Priors") is hypothesized to yield unrelated results like Bayesian denoising in photon-counting or image processing. Related causal surveys highlight deep learning integrations but not directly as specific probabilistic, fairness-enforced extension for diagnostics, as in this proposed CBD-DANP.

- Essentially, this method focuses on self-reported medical conditions such as Depression, and other related.

# Why This Addresses this Problem Effectively
- Subjectivity Handling: By inferring true label posteriors via adaptive priors (e.g., Beta distributions parameterized by demographic clusters), it avoids assuming observed labels as ground truth, directly tackling noise from self-reports or cultural differences across continents.
- Causal Disentanglement: SCMs (e.g., via do-calculus) model paths like demographics → confounders (job status/income) → label noise/depression, correcting spurious associations that could bias predictions.
- Fairness and Interpretability: Posterior penalties (e.g., KL-divergence terms for equitable error rates) ensure the model doesn't exacerbate biases, while Bayesian inference provides uncertainty estimates (e.g., credible intervals) for clinical use.
- Novelty Validation: This combination is novel for tabular data in mental health; closest analogs are general instance-dependent noise SCMs or fairness in biased labels, but without Bayesian unification or demographic focus in depression.

### Implementation Suggestions
To prototype of my proposed CBD-DANP:

1. Model Structure:
   - **Likelihood**: Observed label \( y_i \) ~ Bernoulli(π_i), where π_i is a noisy proxy for true depression z_i, with noise rate η(d_i) dependent on demographics d_i (e.g., via a Gaussian process or neural net prior).
   - **Causal Component**: Define an SCM with nodes for demographics, confounders, z_i, and y_i. Use Pearl's causal graphs to estimate interventions (e.g., Pyro for probabilistic programming).
   - **Priors**: Adaptive η ~ Dirichlet(α(d_i)), clustered by demographics (e.g., via k-means on age/gender/income).
   - **Fairness Penalty**: Add a term to the ELBO or posterior, e.g., minimizing variance in error rates across groups.

2. Tools/Libraries: Use Pyro or PyMC for Bayesian inference; DoWhy or CausalML for SCMs; AIF360 for fairness metrics. Start with simulated data: Generate tabular datasets with injected demographic-dependent noise (e.g., higher false negatives for low-income groups).

3. Evaluation: Use synthetic benchmarks with known noise, then real datasets (e.g., from WHO depression surveys). Metrics: Calibrated AUC, fairness gaps (e.g., equalized odds), and uncertainty calibration.

This framework could indeed innovate in equitable mental health modeling. But the current results fall short of expectation. The trying continues!
